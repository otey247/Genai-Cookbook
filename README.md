# Generative AI Application Cookbook

Welcome to the **Generative AI Cookbook**! This guide serves as a comprehensive collection of "recipes" and "meals" to help developers build and deploy generative AI applications efficiently. Here, you’ll find step-by-step instructions for essential components (recipes), and full application scenarios (meals) designed to serve real-world business needs.

## Introduction

This cookbook is designed to help developers, architects, and AI enthusiasts create, integrate, and optimize generative AI applications. Each recipe focuses on a specific functionality or component, like **Document Extraction**, **Access Control**, or **LLM Proxy and Chargeback**. Meals are complete solutions, combining several recipes into an end-to-end application, like an **AI-powered Customer Support Assistant** or a **Searchable Document Repository**


### Key Concepts

- **Meals (Use Cases)**: Complete end-to-end solutions that solve specific business problems
- **Recipes (Components)**: Individual functional components that can be combined into meals
- **Ingredients (Tools & Services)**: The technical tools, services, and resources used in recipes
- **Chefs (Developers)**: The technical professionals who combine recipes into complete meals

## Recipes

Recipes are modular components that address specific functionalities within generative AI applications. Each recipe includes required **ingredients**, **preparation steps**, **methods**, and **best practices**.

Some key recipes include:
- [Document Extraction](recipes/data_handling_and_retrieval/document_extraction.md)
- [OAuth-based Document Access Control](recipes/data_handling_and_retrieval/document_access_control.md)
- [LLM Proxy & Chargeback](recipes/cost_management_and_optimization/llm_proxy_chargeback.md)
- [Monitoring Framework](recipes/monitoring_security_and_compliance/monitoring_framework.md)


Our recipes are organized into the following categories:

- **Core Generative AI Capabilities**
- **Data Handling and Retrieval**
- **Agentic and Tool-Enabled Assistants**
- **Experimentation and Evaluation**
- **Deployment and Scalability**
- **Monitoring, Security, and Compliance**
- **Cost Management and Optimization**
- **Personalization and User Experience**


##  Meals

Meals are comprehensive use cases crafted by combining several recipes to address specific business requirements. Each meal includes detailed steps for integration, deployment, and optimization to guide developers in creating complete generative AI solutions.

- [AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant](meals/ai_powered_customer_support_assistant.md)
- [Searchable Document Repository](meals/searchable_document_repository.md)
- [Automated Report Generation](meals/automated_report_generation.md)


## Ingredients

Ingredients refer to the tools, libraries, and services used to create each recipe. They include resources from major hyperscalers like **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**, as well as open-source libraries and specialized AI/ML tools.


## Chefs' Skillset

To “prepare” a meal, developers need certain skills. Each skill supports efficient development and deployment, from **Data Handling and Preprocessing** to **Cost Optimization**. A detailed guide on each skill is available in the "Chef's Skillset" section.


## Getting Started

To start, choose a **meal** (use case) that aligns with your goal, then follow the instructions to gather the required **recipes**. Detailed setup guides are provided in each recipe.
