# Generative AI Application Cookbook

Welcome to the Generative AI Application Cookbook! This repository contains recipes, patterns, and complete solutions for building production-ready generative AI applications. Think of this cookbook as your guide to creating AI solutions, where developers are chefs crafting meals (complete solutions) from various recipes (components) using different ingredients (tools and services).

##  How to Use This Cookbook

### Key Concepts

- **👩‍🍳 Chefs (Developers)**: The technical professionals who combine recipes into complete meals
- **🍽️ Meals (Use Cases)**: Complete end-to-end solutions that solve specific business problems
- **📑 Recipes (Components)**: Individual functional components that can be combined into meals
- **🧂 Ingredients (Tools & Services)**: The technical tools, services, and resources used in recipes
